# Automation-of-Propeller-3D-Modeling
<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Establish a propeller 3D model in Rhino by Python programming. Realized converting points data of benchmarkpropeller stored in CSV to a completed and precise 3D model with surfaces.

In todayâ€™s  naval architecture field, computer aided design haslaid more and more emphasis on its increased accuracy and convenience for modelingprocesses. For the entire design of a ship or an offshore structure, propeller design would be one of the trickiest proportions since it has a twisted blade which shall meet the accuracy file requirement for best hydrodynamic performance. This research is rooted in the interactive propeller design process in Rhino 6, a modeling software, learned in NAME 5141 Curve Surface Design lectured by Dr. Lothar Birk from the University of New Orleans.

This report will express the idea of how to convert the manual design process into anautomated process by elaborating the procedures on both methods, meanwhile, to show  the differencesas well. Programming language here would be Python and mostly code work is done in Rhino_script syntax, a scripting environment in Rhino. In the end, a conclusion and a future scope is outlinedfor furtherworkin this project.
